# Secure-File-organiser
The system classifies files automatically, creates backups before processing, applies category-based permissions, generates SHA-256 checksums, verifies integrity, and logs every action with timestamps. An optional Tkinter GUI makes it easy for non-technical users to run the organizer and check file integrity.
